            <p>This is a guide to help you understand basic JavaScript functions. For instance, declaring a variable is as simple as typing <code>let x = 10;</code>.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
                Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="what_you_should_already_know" class="main-section">
            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>To print to the console, use the following syntax:</p>
            <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience.</li>
        </section>
        <section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
            <header>Javascript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
                You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="variable" class="main-section">
            <header>Variable</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
                letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>Another way to use variables is in an array:</p>
            <code>const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</code>
            <p>For more complex operations, you can define a function like this:</p>
            <code>
            function sum(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }
            </code>
            <p>
            To call this function, you would write <code>sum(5, 3);</code> which returns 8.</p>
